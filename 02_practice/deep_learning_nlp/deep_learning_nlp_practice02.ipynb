The story begins with a pilot stranded in the Sahara Desert after his plane crashes. While trying to fix his plane, he meets a mysterious young boy, the Little Prince.\n",

    "The Little Prince comes from a small asteroid called B-612, where he lives alone with a rose that he loves deeply. He recounts his journey to the pilot, describing his visits to several other planets. Each planet is inhabited by a different character, such as a king, a vain man, a drunkard, a businessman, a geographer, and a fox. Through these encounters, the Prince learns valuable lessons about love, responsibility, and the nature of adult behavior.\n",

    "On Earth, the Little Prince meets various creatures, including a fox, who teaches him about relationships and the importance of taming, which means building ties with others. The fox's famous line, \"You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed,\" resonates with the Prince's feelings for his rose.\n",
